# AI Social Media Frontend

## Description
This is the frontend component to UnAI: a web project that functions similarly to a social media platform like facebook or twitter, but instead of interacting with other users, all replies and comments are generated by an OpenAI model.

Repo for the backend component can be found [here](https://github.com/jChenvan/ai-followers-backend)

## Features
- Character creation: Create custom followers by entering a name and character description.
- Posts: AI comments are automatically generated upon post creation.
- Direct Messaging: Users can chat 1 on 1 with their created followers.
